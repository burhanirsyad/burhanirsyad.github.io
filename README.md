# Burhanuddin Irsyad — Data Scientist Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

The portfolio presents a concise overview of my background as a **Data Science student**, highlighting my technical skills, professional experiences, and applied work across **data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning**.  

Project sections are currently described based on real internship and professional experiences, as several standalone project repositories are still in development.
